# Feature Generation

This project focuses on predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds using various machine learning techniques. The project is divided into two main parts: feature generation using PaDEL and RDKit, and the main processing and analysis of these features.

## Files

### 1. `Padel_Feature.ipynb`

This notebook is responsible for generating chemical descriptors using the PaDEL-Descriptor software. It performs the following steps:

1. **Installation and Imports**: Installs the `padelpy` package and imports necessary libraries.
2. **Load Data**: Reads the input data containing SMILES strings from `CombinedResearchPaperData.csv`.
3. **Prepare SMILES File**: Extracts SMILES strings and saves them to a `.smi` file.
4. **Generate 2D Descriptors**: Uses PaDEL-Descriptor to generate 2D  and 3D descriptors for the molecules in the `.smi` file, saving the results to `2d.csv` and `3d.csv`.

### 2. RDKIT_Feature.ipynb`

This notebook handles the main processing and analysis tasks, including feature calculation and selection. It performs the following steps:

1. **Imports and Helper Functions**: Imports necessary libraries and defines functions to calculate RDKit descriptors and Morgan fingerprints.
2. **Load Data**: Reads the input data, processes SMILES strings, and generates RDKit descriptors and Morgan fingerprints.
3. **Feature Concatenation**: Combines the calculated features with the original data, including toxicity labels and source information, and saves the result to `generated_features.csv`.
4. **Feature Selection**: Drops features with all zero values, calculates and visualizes correlations, and prepares the data for further analysis.

## Usage

To run these notebooks, you need to have the required packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pip install padelpy pandas numpy rdkit seaborn matplotlib
\`\`\`

1. **Run `Padel_Feature.ipynb`**:
   - Ensure the input file `CombinedResearchPaperData.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to generate the `2d.csv` file containing 2D descriptors.

2. **Run `main.ipynb`**:
   - Ensure the `2d.csv` file generated from the previous notebook is available.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to calculate RDKit descriptors and Morgan fingerprints, concatenate features, and perform feature selection.

## Output

- `2d.csv`: Contains the 2D descriptors generated by PaDEL-Descriptor.
- `3d.csv`: Contains the 3D descriptors generated by PaDEL-Descriptor.
- `generated_features.csv`: Contains the combined features (PaDEL descriptors, RDKit descriptors, and Morgan fingerprints) along with toxicity labels and source information.

## creating mergered.csv
-Combining all these feature based on there Smiles string , we get our mererged.csv.This code has not been present here.
-On it contradicting lable(duplicate smiles string) have ben removed
